# AndroidNanodegree

## AsteroidRadar
Second Android nanodegree Project.

### Getting Started
* An API Key is needed to be changed in the AsteroidRepository.kt from DEMO_KEY to a valid API Key

### How it works
When opened, the app will fetch asteroids from the Nasa Service for the Day. Using the options Menu, the asteroids of the week or the full collection of them saved on the database can be selected to show on list.

The Asteroid Radar also creates a worker that will download Asteroid data each day and delete asteroids from days past once a day.
