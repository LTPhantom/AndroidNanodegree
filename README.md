## AsteroidRadar
Second Android nanodegree Project.

### Getting Started
* An API Key is needed to be changed in the AsteroidRepository.kt from DEMO_KEY to a valid API Key

### How it works
When opened, the app will get the saved asteroids from the database. If there is nothing saved, the list will not show anything until the option to 'View week asteroids' or 'View today's asteroids' is chosen.

The Asteroid Radar also creates a worker that will download Asteroid data each day and delete asteroids from days past once a day.
